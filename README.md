## Transforming Unstructured Data to Structured: Standards, Logic, and Language Models

**Abstract:**
In unstructured data, only simple querying is possible; complex queries need structured data, i.e., data elements with defined properties and formalized relationships. The course introduces ontologies and knowledge graphs, their design and population with data. A special focus is on the data FAIRness, discovery, and reusability. Next, the course introduces the description logic and inference capabilities of knowledge graphs using standards such as RDF(S) and OWL. The power of knowledge graphs is demonstrated using a special query language as well as English on our own and well-known knowledge graphs (DBPedia). Finally, we discover how large language models can support ontology building and querying.
