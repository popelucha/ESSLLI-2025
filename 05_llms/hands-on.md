# Day 5: Hands-on

## From Natural Language to Knowledge Graph

**TASK**

Find a short factual text (about three paragraphs). Ask [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to convert it to knowledge graphs. Play with the prompt, so that the resulting graph uses linked open vocabularies and known ontologies. Display the result using [RDF Grapher](https://www.ldf.fi/service/rdf-grapher).

Hint: ChatGPT is better at producing the Turtle format than other formats.

**TASK**

Open the following [Python Notebook in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jwOqgj0pq2FDv-AP6SDGk8CRvX3l1MIL?usp=sharing), make sure that you use Google T4 GPUs (if you have a free Google account, you'll have access to them up to a quota).

Go through the notebook and all its tasks. Feel free to reuse the code for your own experiments.
