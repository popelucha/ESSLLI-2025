# Day 5: Hands-on

## From Natural Language to Knowledge Graph

**TASK**

Find a short factual text (about three paragraphs). Ask [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to convert it to knowledge graphs. Play with the prompt, so that the resulting graph uses linked open vocabularies and known ontologies. Display the result using [RDF Grapher](https://www.ldf.fi/service/rdf-grapher).

Hint: ChatGPT is better at producing the Turtle format than other formats.
