# Installation instructions - Protégé

Protégé comes in two versions: the version for Linux comes with the Java runtime. If you already installed [OpenRefine](install-OpenRefine), you can use the other option - the platform independent version.

Download Protégé from [the projects' website](https://protege.stanford.edu/software.php#desktop-protege). It asks you for registration but you can skip this step.

The platform independent version may need some tackling around setting the `$EFFECTIVE_JAVA_HOME` variable in the `run.sh` script.
If you are not sure what to do and use Linux, I recommend to use the full version.


Run Protégé from its main directory:

```
./run.sh
```

In Windows (and the independent version):
```
./run.bat
```
