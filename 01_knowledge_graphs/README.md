## Retrieval Championship

> There was no general purpose console in his room, so he had to go down to the lobby to get the information he required. As luck would have it, the cubicle was occupied by an old lady who took so long to find what she wanted that Morgan almost pounded on the door. But at last the sluggard left with a mumbled apology, and Morgan was face to face with the accumulated art and knowledge of all mankind.

## How would you solve the problem with todays' tools?

- full text engine (old school)
- modern search engine (linked to knowledge sources)
- large language model (LLM)

---

- faceted search (similar to domain specific search engines)
- multi-hop search

## Structured and unstructured data

two views on data:

- structured: database view (tables, relations, ...)
- unstructured: documents as streams of characters

"Unstructured" means unstructured from computational point of view.
Unstructured data have no predefined data model.

However, unstructured data are structured from the human POV.
